  object,
  samples,
  contrasts,
  parameter.to.test = "orig_ident",
  test.to.use = "MAST",
  log.fc.threshold = 0.25,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat-class object}

\item{samples}{Samples to be included in the analysis}

\item{contrasts}{Contrasts in the "A-B" format}

\item{parameter.to.test}{Select the metadata column that you would like
to use to perform your DEG analysis and construct your contrasts from.
Default is "orig_ident"}

\item{test.to.use}{The kind of algorithm you would like to use
to perform your DEG analysis. Default is the MAST algorithm
(wilcox,bimod,roc,t,negbinom,poisson,LR,MAST,DESeq2).}

\item{log.fc.threshold}{The minimum log fold-change between contrasts
that you would like to analyze. Default is 0.25}

\item{use.spark}{Opt to use Spark to parallelize computations.
Default is FALSE}

\item{assay.to.use}{The assay to use for your DEG analysis.
Default is SCT, but can use linearly scaled data by selecting RNA instead}
}
\value{
a dataframe with DEG.

\description{
This function performs a DEG (differential expression of genes)
analysis on a merged Seurat object to identify expression markers
between different groups of cells (contrasts).
}
\details{
The recommended input is a merged Seurat object
with SingleR annotations, along with its associated sample names and metadata
}
