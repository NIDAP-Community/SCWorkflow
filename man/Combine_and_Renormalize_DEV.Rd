\arguments{
\item{npcs}{Select the number of principal components for your analysis. Please see the elbow plot in the previous template to figure out what number of PCs explains your variance cut-off. For example, if the elbow plot has point at (15,0.02), it means that 15 PCs encapsulate 98\% of the variance in your data.}

\item{integratedata}{Perform integration of cells across conditions using the most variant genes to identify cells most similar to each other.  N.B. Always look at cells before deciding whether to perform integration, and seek advice from bioinformatician.}

\item{clust.res.low}{Select minimum resolution for clustering plots. The lower you set this, the FEWER clusters will be generated.}

\item{clust.res.high}{Select the maximum resolution for clustering. The higher you set this number, the MORE clusters you will produced.}

\item{clust.res.bin}{Select the bins for your cluster plots. For example, if you input 0.2 as your bin, and have low/high resolution ranges of 0.2 and 0.6, then the template will produce cluster plots at resolutions of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6.}

\item{only.var.genes}{If dataset is larger than ~40k filtered cells, toggle to TRUE. If TRUE, only variable genes will be available for downstream analysis. Default is FALSE.}

\item{draw.umap}{If TRUE, draw UMAP plot.}

\item{draw.tsne}{If TRUE, draw TSNE plot.}

\item{imageType}{Select output image type. Options: png, svg}

\item{nfeatures}{Number of variable features.}

\item{low.cut}{description.}

\item{high.cut}{description.}

\item{low.cut.disp}{description.}

\item{high.cut.disp}{description.}

\item{selection.method}{Method to choose top variable features. Options: vst, mean.var.plot, dispersion}

\item{cell.hashing.data}{Toggle "true" if you are using cell-hashed data.}

\item{project.name}{description.}

\item{seed.for.PCA}{description.}

\item{seed.for.TSNE}{description.}

\item{seed.for.UMAP}{description.}

\item{SCTransform}{Set to TRUE to run SCTransform (recommended current v3 Seurat default). Set to FALSE to run ScaleData (previous v2 Seurat default) instead.}

\item{exclude.sample}{Exclude unwanted samples from the merge step. Include sample names to be removed. If you want to exclude several samples, separate each sample number by comma (e.g. sample1,sample2,sample3,sample4).}

\item{object}{description.}

\item{vars_to_regress}{Subtract (‘regress out’) this source of heterogeneity from the data. For example, to regress out mitochondrial effects, input "percent.mt." Options: percent.mt, nCount_RNA, S.Score, G2M.Score, CC.Difference}
}
\value{
Seurat Objects and QC plots. Combines samples, rescales and renormalizes, runs Dimensional Reduction, and returns a combined Seurat Object. This template will summarize the multi-dimensionality of your data into a set of "principal components" to allow for easier analysis. There is an option to use this template to perform Integration, as well. This is Step 4 in the canonical Single Cell pipeline after elbow plots and regression.
